   <h1>What is beyblade</h1>
   <h3>Contributed by Harshith Kakarla</h3> 
   <h3>History</h3>
   <p>Beyblade was originally an idea for a toy series that was first produced by Takara, a Japanese toy company looking for something that would make them stand out from other toy manufacturers. Eventually, they made Beyblade, a new twist on the spinning top. The first few Beyblades were released in 1999, and were officially sold in the US from 2002 onwards. Hasbro purchased the license from Takara and made it their official Japanese partner. The toy line was adapted by Hasbro and made widely available to the American and European markets. In 2002, Takara merged with Tomy, another Japanese company, and used both of their talents to increase the quality of Beyblades significantly. Hasbro usually sought out to make each season of Beyblade unique, and so from Burst onwards each season had its own exclusive gimmick or feature that made it stand out. In the modern-day, Hasbro is known to make fun but lower quality Beys, while TT (Takara Tomy) is known for making high-quality yet expensive Beys (import costs lol), usually tailored toward collectors or hardcore fans.</p><br>

   <h3>The seasons of beyblade</h3>
   <p>  It started out with the Beyblade manga, simply titled: Beyblade (now known as the Plastic Gen), which was written by Takao Aoki. He also went on to write the Metal saga, which was extremely popular as the Beys now had more metal and also used a completely different system. Keep in mind, though, that all of this was just marketing for TT’s toy line. The manga inspired an anime production, retroactively named Beyblade: Metal Saga, which encompasses four seasons: Metal Fusion, Metal Masters, Metal Fury and Shogun Steel. The anime was produced by Tatsunoko Pro and SynergySP.  In July 15th, 2015, Hiro Morita released Beyblade Burst, a manga about TT’s revolutionary new Burst system.</p><br>

   <h3>Anime</h3>
   <p>The Beyblade burst series (Beyblade burst, Beyblade burst God, Beyblade burst Chouzetsu, Beyblade burst Gatinko, and finally the current season of Beyblade, Beyblade burst SuperKing.) had a worldwide run with the anime, becoming extremely popular and generally becoming a humongous success. The anime was always based off of the manga, but generally the anime and manga are known to have differences in the storyline and sometimes even the plot. All seasons of the burst saga are on YouTube, with English dubbing and occasional censorship of some features not included in Hasbro beys. Same goes for the earlier series, as the anime was extremely good (except for logic, looking at you, Metal Saga) and animation errors were so uncommon they ended up as a meme.</p><br>

   <h3>TL: DR</h3>
   <p>Beyblades are essentially just battling tops, and Takara saw the potential and made a toy line out of it. This said toy line had several mangas written about it, and many, many changes and evolutions to lead to the Beyblade Burst SuperKing system today.
